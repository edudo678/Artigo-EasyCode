% This file may be used without modification as a style (.sty) file.
%
% If you have Mittelbach's doc.sty, this file may be formatted with a
% command like:
%                latex indentfirst.sty
%
% If you have the Mittelbach/Duchier/Braams docstrip utility, you may
% produce a faster loading .sty file.
% Rename this file to: indentfirst.doc
% Then run this file through *plain* TeX:
%                tex indentfirst.doc
% This should produce the file indentfirst.sty.
% If you do not have plain TeX on your system, you can trick LaTeX into
% doing the work as follows:
%                latex \def\fmtname{plain} \input indentfirst.doc
% Note that you may need to quote the arguments here to stop your
% operating system treating the \ characters incorrectly.
%
%                latex indentfirst.doc
% Will produce a typeset version of the documentation, as above.
